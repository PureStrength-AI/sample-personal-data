## Objective:
Highly skilled and motivated software developer with 3 years of experience specializing in building iOS applications. Seeking a challenging position to leverage my technical expertise and contribute to the development of innovative mobile solutions.

## Education:
- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**  
  IIIT-Delhi, India  
  Year of Graduation: 2020

## Skills:
- Proficient in iOS app development using Swift and Objective-C
- Strong knowledge of iOS frameworks such as SwiftUI, UIKit, Vision, CoreML, and Core Data
- Experience with version control systems (Git)
- Familiarity with RESTful APIs and JSON
- Solid understanding of software development principles and best practices
- Excellent problem-solving and debugging skills
- Strong verbal and written communication skills
- Ability to work effectively in both team and individual settings

## Experience:
### iOS and ML Engineer  
**VisioLab, Germany**  
May 2023 - Present

- Developed automated Checkout iPadOS apps for canteens following the MVVM architecture using SwiftUI, UIKit, Vision, and CoreML, resulting in 1M+ automated checkouts with over $3 million in sales.
- Integrated different cash-registers for payment using services like Bluetooth, REST APIs, and Local Network connections.
- Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Fastlane for seamless TestFlight distribution, and reduced costs by using self-runners. Ultimately, moved to Xcode Cloud.
- Proposed and developed an active-learning pipeline to enhance the food checkout experience. Created an MVP iOS app using Swift and on-device training to automate the process of adding new food classes.

### CTO  
**Remote**  
April 2022 - September 2023

- Single-handedly developed, maintained, released, and optimized the PureStrength iOS app with a rating of over 4.8 stars, and its corresponding AWS and Firebase cloud backends.
- Worked on low-level Objective-C bridging to run custom TorchScript models, such as DensePose, on iOS devices. Created animations for human contour plotting using Swift and optimized using a C++ wrapper for OpenCV.
- Trained DensePose and YOLO deep learning models using PyTorch to track barbell weights in the gym. Then, I converted the models for mobile use using TorchScript and CoreML tools.
- Wrote a non-trivial analysis to calculate velocity, range of motion using barbell weight trajectories, and optimized the inference procedure by multithreading and using parallel queues, reducing inference time by 70%.

### Cloud Platforms Engineer  
**Hyderabad, India**  
June 2020 - April 2022

- Integrated MATLAB with Amazon SageMaker using a Dockerized approach to run MATLAB in a Jupyter environment. Demonstrated the advantages of spot training and parallel hyperparameter tuning. Created a Jupyter notebook that was used and shared by AWS in their tutorials.
- Developed an open-source MVP for MATLAB on Linux for Google Cloud using Packer and Terraform technologies.
- Maintained and released MATLAB reference architecture for Amazon and Azure cloud.
- Implemented deep learning solutions for lane detection in MATLAB. Used iterative labeling to annotate raw images with minimal human help.

### Bachelor's Thesis  
**Dehli, India**  
June 2019 - May 2020

- Used PyTorch to train a Mask-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, and Domain Adaptive Faster-RCNN to count the number of bees in beehive images.
- Wrote iterative labeling scripts for annotating bee datasets with minimal human help.
- Proposed a novel domain-adaptive SSD with multi-level domain adaptation to work with bees of different sizes and colors.
- Verified generalizability of the proposed method by running experiments on standard domain-adaptive datasets.
